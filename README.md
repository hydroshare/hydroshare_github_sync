# hydroshare_github_sync

A github action that syncs files from a hydroshare collection into a GitHub repository

Currently this is configured to sync from the following resource:
[https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/ac6cc75dcb0146cf9cc17a974f4bb08b/](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/ac6cc75dcb0146cf9cc17a974f4bb08b/)

This repository supports the "Launch in MyBinder" functionality for the [SwotViz site](https://swotvis-staging.cuahsi.io/#/notebooks)

The idea is that notebooks can be launched using a url something like
[https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hydroshare/hydroshare_github_sync/main?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2F%2F1cc0fdda275340ff9d6682627d09a3b9%2Fdata%2Fcontents](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hydroshare/hydroshare_github_sync/main?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2F%2F1cc0fdda275340ff9d6682627d09a3b9%2Fdata%2Fcontents)
